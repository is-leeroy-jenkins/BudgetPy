## Overview
The **Outlay Projector** is a forecasting model that uses historical expenditure data, 
generative AI, and machine-learning to project future outlays by agency and fiscal year.
- Data-Driven Forecasting ‚Äì Uses historical budget data from FY1962 to FY2024 to predict FY2025 and beyond.  
- Machine Learning Integration ‚Äì Gradient Boosting, Bayesian Ridge, and Polynomial Regressions for high-accuracy predictions.

## ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/BudgetPy/blob/master/etc/img/github/features.png)  Features
- Time Series Forecasting ‚Äì Leverages ARIMA and Holt-Winters models to analyze seasonal and trend-based variations in budgetary spending.  
- Batch Processing for Large Datasets ‚Äì Optimized for handling extensive federal financial data without memory overload.  
- Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis ‚Äì Utilizes PCA, Min-Max Scaling, Z-score Standardization, and K-Means clustering to enhance model performance.  
- Automated Outlay Projections ‚Äì Provides yearly budget forecasts per agency with a simple data frame output.

> Vectorization is the process of converting textual data into numerical vectors and is a process that is usually applied once the text is cleaned.
> It can help improve the execution speed and reduce the training time of your code. Bubba provides the following vector stores on the OpenAI platform to support environmental data analysis with machine-learning

- #### [Federal Appropriations](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/BudgetPy/blob/master/etc/img/github/Appropriations.md) - vectorized data set of federal appropriations available for fine-tuning learning models
- #### [Federal Regulations](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/BudgetPy/blob/master/etc/img/github/Regulations.md) - vectorized dat aset of federal, financial regulations available for fine-tuning learning models

> Badger incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to extract insights from large datasets.
> This includes the use of vector embeddings and predictive modeling to forecast contaminant spread and resource optimization to allocate resources effectively during emergencies

> Badger incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to extract insights from large datasets.
This includes the use of vector embeddings and predictive modeling to forecast contaminant spread and resource optimization to allocate resources effectively during emergencies.
Badger interacts with pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and o1-mini  to enhance its analytical capabilities.
Users leverage LLMs for rapid information retrieval from vast datasets, automated report generation, and potentially even expert consultation
