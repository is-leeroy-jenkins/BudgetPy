### ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/BudgetPy/blob/master/etc/img/github/training.png)  Overview
- Projections of federal outlays, as required by law, reflect the assumption that current laws will generally remain unchanged. Those projections 
encompass the current year—the year in which the projections are made and a projection period of 5 
or 10 years in the future. 
- BudgetPy incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to extract insights from large datasets. 
- Vector embeddings and predictive modeling to forecast contaminant spread and resource optimization to allocate resources effectively during emergencies. 
- BudgetPy interacts with pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) like Leeroy, Boo, and Bobo as weel as GPT-4o, o3, and o1-mini to enhance its analytical capabilities. 
- Users leverage LLMs for rapid information retrieval from vast datasets, automated report generation, and potentially even expert consultation

### ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/BudgetPy/blob/master/etc/img/github/training.png) How It Works
#### 1️⃣ **Data Processing**
- Loads federal budget data from **"Budget Outlays.xlsx"**.
- Filters **fiscal year data (2012–2024)** and groups outlays **by agency**.
- Handles **missing values and data inconsistencies**.
  
#### 2️⃣ **Model Training**
- Uses **Random Forest Regression** as the primary predictive model.
- Splits data into **training (80%) and testing (20%)** sets.
- Trains on **FY2012-FY2023** to predict **FY2024** and validates performance.

#### 3️⃣ **Outlay Forecasting**
- Predicts **FY2025 outlays for each federal agency**.
- Outputs results in a structured **data frame** for easy interpretation.
